## Hello!
My name is **Konstantin**, I am a beginner software developer with some great ideas.

My primary programming language is **Go**, but I can also work with **Python**, **C\#**, and **PHP** codebases.  
I also have experience writing low-level C code as an exercise, such as my old [OSDev project](https://github.com/axllr8tr/osdev) for x86.

I can be reached at `axllr8tr at gmail dot com`, or on [Telegram](https://t.me/axllr8tr).

> [!WARNING]
> I am currently in process of migrating my code repositories to GitHub, so my activity graph will look a bit off. Please wait warmly.
